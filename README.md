## Hi there 👋

I am a final-year Master’s student at Beijing Jiaotong University. My main research interests include reinforcement learning, data mining, diffusion models and large language models. I have been working on deployable decision-making policies in traffic signal control and sim-to-real reinforcement learning.

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position in reinforcement learning, embodied AI or large language models starting in Fall 2026, appreciate any opportunities!**
