I am a final-year Master’s student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University. My main research interests include reinforcement learning, data mining and diffusion models. I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position in reinforcement learning, embodied AI or large language models starting in Fall 2026, appreciate any opportunities!
